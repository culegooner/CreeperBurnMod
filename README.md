CreeperBurnMod
==============

https://github.com/culegooner/CreeperBurnMod

This minecraft 1.6.1 mod uses events to set creepers on fire when under direct sunlight.
This is not a coremode, it doesn't modify any base classes. instead it triggers an event whenever a creeper is spawned and replaces them.

Don't install this with the CreeperBurnCore.

This is part of a tutorial on forge 1.6.1 events and coremods
