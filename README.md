This minecraft 1.6 mod uses events to set creepers on fire when under direct sunlight.
This is not a coremode, it doesn't modify any base classes. 
Instead it triggers an event whenever a creeper is spawned and replaces them.

You're not supposed to install this with the CreeperBurnCore mod.

This is part of a tutorial on forge 1.6 events and coremods
